# CryptoZombies Solidity Practice

This repo contains my implementations from the CryptoZombies course.  
Includes basic Solidity smart contracts for zombie creation, feeding, attacks, and simple game logic.

### Files
- `ZombieFactory.sol` – create zombies and generate DNA  
- `ZombieFeeding.sol` – feed zombies and create new ones  
- `ZombieHelper.sol` – utility functions and modifiers  
- `ZombieAttack.sol` – attack logic and win/loss tracking  
- `Ownable.sol` – ownership control

### How to use
Open the `.sol` files in Remix or any Solidity environment, compile with the version in the `pragma`, and run the functions to test the game logic.

That's it.
